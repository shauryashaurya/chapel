This directory contains Chapel written versions of the "One Billion Row
Challenge" (https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc).

In these versions we're less focused on getting the absolute best performance
possible and rather as using it as a benchmark to study (parallel) I/O
performance.

Versions in this directory includes:

  python_version.py - Naive Python implementation using Python's csv parser and
                      storing results in separate dictionaries.
  
  parSafeMapVer -     Stores results in individual parSafeMaps.  This version
                      has a config constant that can be used to run in serial
                      mode as well.

  aggregators -       Accumulate results in per-task map that flushes to
                      global map.

  concurrentMapVer -  Uses ConcurrentMap package and custom aggregator.
